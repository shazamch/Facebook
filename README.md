Title: Facebook Clone without Photos

Description:
This is a Python project that recreates a simplified version of Facebook without photos. The program features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to create an account, log in, add friends, post status updates, and view their friends' posts. The project was developed using the Tkinter library for GUI and SQLite for database management.

Features:

User account creation: Users can create a new account by providing their name, email, and password.
Login: Users can log in to their accounts using their email and password.
Add Friends: Users can search for other users by name and add them as friends.
Status Update: Users can post status updates that are visible to their friends.
View Posts: Users can view the status updates of their friends in a news feed style layout.

Technical Details:

The project was developed in Python 3 using the Tkinter library for the GUI.
The SQLite database was used to store user information, friend lists, and status updates.
The project features error handling for invalid user input and login credentials.

Future Improvements:

Implementation of additional features such as commenting on posts and direct messaging.
Optimization of the program's performance for larger user groups.
Incorporation of user feedback to improve the user experience.
Overall, this project is a great example of how Python can be used to create functional, user-friendly applications with a simple interface.

Note: Make sure all the files in the same folder after downloading. If any file is missing the code will give error. Also create a folder in the main foler named "test_images" and place the images in this folder.
